# Security Guidelines

## Overview
This repository provides secure MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for security platform integrations.

## Security Features Implemented

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Query length limits and character filtering
- Protection against injection attacks (SQL, SPL, FQL)

### Secure Communications
- Enforced HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for all API communications
- Strong cipher suite configuration
- Certificate validation enabled by default

### Error Handling
- Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Sensitive data filtering in logs
- No credential exposure in error responses

### Authentication Security
- Secure token/credential handling
- No hardcoded credentials in configuration files
- Session management with proper expiration

## Security Configuration

### SSL/TLS Settings
- Minimum TLS version: 1.2
- Certificate verification: Required
- Strong cipher suites only

### API Rate Limiting
- Query result limits (max 1000-10000 results)
- Request timeout enforcement
- Connection pooling limits

### Data Protection
- Sensitive field filtering from API responses
- Credential masking in logs
- Secure configuration templates

## Security Recommendations

### Credentials Management
1. Never commit real credentials to version control
2. Use environment variables or secure secret management
3. Rotate credentials regularly
4. Use least-privilege access principles

### Network Security
1. Deploy servers in secure network segments
2. Use firewall rules to restrict access
3. Monitor and log all API interactions
4. Implement network-level rate limiting

### Monitoring
1. Enable comprehensive logging
2. Monitor for unusual query patterns
3. Set up alerts for authentication failures
4. Regular security assessments

## Vulnerability Reporting
If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. Do not create a public issue
2. Email security details to the maintainer
3. Allow reasonable time for fixes before disclosure

## Security Updates
- Monitor dependencies for security updates
- Apply security patches promptly
- Review and update configurations regularly
