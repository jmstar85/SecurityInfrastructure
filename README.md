# Test server security
python src/splunk_server.py        # Runs on localhost:8080
python src/crowdstrike_server.py   # Runs on localhost:8081  
python src/misp_server.py          # Runs on localhost:8082
```

## üîß MCP Server Tools

### Splunk SIEM Tools (Security Hardened)
- `search-events`: Execute sanitized SPL queries with injection prevention
  ```python
  # Example: Secure search for failed login attempts
  query = "index=security sourcetype=auth action=failure"  # Automatically sanitized
  earliest_time = "-24h"  # Validated time format
  ```

### CrowdStrike EDR Tools (Security Hardened)
- `search-detections`: Query detections with FQL validation and whitelisting
  ```python
  # Example: Secure search for high severity detections
  filter_query = "max_severity:'high'"  # Validated against injection patterns
  sort = "created_timestamp.desc"  # Whitelisted sort options only
  ```

### MISP Tools (Security Hardened)
- `search-events`: Query threat intelligence with input sanitization
- `search-attributes`: Search IOCs with XSS and injection prevention
  ```python
  # Example: Secure search for IP-based IOCs
  type = "ip-dst"  # Input sanitized and validated
  category = "Network activity"  # Content filtered for safety
  ```

## üîß Secure MCP Client Configuration

### Claude Desktop Setup (Secure)

**Configuration File Location:**
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Secure Configuration Template:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "security-infrastructure-splunk": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/SecurityInfrastructure/src/splunk_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "SPLUNK_HOST": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SPLUNK_HOST",
        "SPLUNK_TOKEN": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_TOKEN",
        "SPLUNK_VERIFY_SSL": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:** Never commit real credentials to version control. Use the provided templates and replace placeholders with actual values.

## üíª Secure Usage Examples

Once securely configured with Claude Desktop, you can use natural language to interact with your security platforms:

### Splunk SIEM Queries (Injection-Safe)
```
"Search for failed SSH login attempts in the last 6 hours"
"Find all authentication events from IP 192.168.1.100"  
"Show me high priority security alerts from yesterday"
"Search for events in the security index containing 'malware'"
```

### CrowdStrike EDR Queries (Validated)
```
"Show me all high severity detections from today"
"Find endpoint detections with behavior patterns"
"List recent detections sorted by creation time"
"Search for detections on specific hostnames"
```

### MISP Threat Intelligence (Sanitized)
```
"Search for events related to specific threat actors"
"Find all IP address indicators of compromise"
"Look up domain indicators from the last week"
"Search for published threat intelligence events about phishing"
```

    if os.path.exists(f):
        with open(f) as file:
            content = file.read()
            if 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR' in content:
                print(f'‚ö†Ô∏è  {f} contains placeholder credentials')
            else:
